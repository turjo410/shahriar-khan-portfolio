## ⚙️ Hardware & Setup

This project uses a real-world IoT setup to capture high-resolution energy data from a common household appliance.

| Measurement Device | Monitored Appliance |
| :---: | :---: |
| **TOMZN Wi-Fi Smart Meter (63A)** | **Sharp SJ-EX315E-SL Refrigerator** |
| <img src="https://img.drz.lazcdn.com/static/bd/p/af92c845f03cea3acefe999f63eba721.jpg_720x720q80.jpg_.webp" width="250"> | <img src="https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/appliance/refrigerator/sj-ex315e-sl/sj-ex315e-sl-01-500x500.webp" width="250"> |
| This smart circuit breaker is installed to measure the electrical parameters of the refrigerator. It connects via Wi-Fi and exports the data using the **Tuya App ecosystem**. | A 253-liter inverter refrigerator was chosen for its cyclical consumption patterns, making it an excellent subject for detailed energy profiling. |

### What Was Measured?

The IoT device captures a rich dataset, allowing for comprehensive analysis of the following key parameters:
- **Active Power (kW):** The real power being consumed by the appliance.
- **Voltage (V) & Current (A):** The fundamental electrical properties of the supply.
- **Power Factor (PF):** A measure of how efficiently the appliance is using electricity.
- **Energy Consumption (kWh):** The cumulative energy used over time.
- **Cumulative Cost (BDT):** The running total of the electricity cost, calculated based on local tariffs.
- **Compressor State:** The On/Off status of the refrigerator's compressor, which is the primary driver of its energy use.

## 🌐 Deployment

This application is configured for seamless deployment on **GitHub Pages**.

> **Note:** The `next.config.js` file is pre-configured with the `basePath` and `assetPrefix` for a repository named `iot-energy-dashboard`. If your repository has a different name, you must update these values in the config file before deploying.

The deployment is handled automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow (`nextjs.yml`) every time a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
